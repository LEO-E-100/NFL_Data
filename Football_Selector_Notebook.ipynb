    "this is on the basis of which will be facing a team that gives more yards on running plays that week.\n",

    "This will require parsing the pro-football-reference as CSV as well as the fixture list for football matches.\n",

    "With this data, the correct opposition for the players can be identified and the opposition stats in that position can\n",
    "be identified. The function will return the right player to choose based on the ranking of the opposition.\n",
